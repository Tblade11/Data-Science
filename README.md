This project illustrates the disparities of fatalities in the workplace, in the year of 2012 in the United States. 
The data that was used shows the difference in fatalities that occurred in each state. 
My synopsis of the data expresses that although there is a trend that shows that fatalities are more likely to happen with less inspectors, it does not correlate that it is absolute due to the outliers that were found.
